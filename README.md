# Project Management System

The Project Management System is a robust and comprehensive solution crafted to streamline project management, helping teams manage, track, and complete projects efficiently. Built using Flutter and Firebase, this application empowers users to oversee every aspect of their projects, from creating and assigning tasks to tracking progress and collaborating with team members. By leveraging Flutter's powerful UI capabilities and Firebase's secure, real-time backend, the system ensures that teams can work together seamlessly, delivering projects on time and within budget.

## Key Features

### 1. Task Management
- **Create, Assign, and Organize Tasks**: Users can create tasks, assign them to specific team members, and prioritize them based on urgency or project needs.
- **Customizable Statuses and Deadlines**: Each task can have a customizable status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed," "Pending") and a deadline to help teams stay on track.
- **Task Prioritization**: Prioritize tasks to help the team focus on critical activities first.

### 2. Team Collaboration
- **Real-Time Communication**: Team members can comment on tasks, share files, and discuss issues in real-time to avoid miscommunication.
- **File Sharing**: Easily upload and share important documents or media files directly within the app.
- **Tagging and Mentions**: Mention teammates to get specific feedback or keep everyone informed.

### 3. Project Tracking
- **Visual Progress Representation**: Track the status of projects with progress bars, Gantt charts, or Kanban boards.
- **Calendar Integration**: View project timelines, task deadlines, and milestones on a calendar, ensuring that no deadline goes unnoticed.
- **Milestones and Goals**: Set project milestones and goals, and track achievements as the project progresses.

### 4. User Management
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Assign roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Contributor) with specific permissions to ensure data security and controlled access.
- **Add or Remove Users**: Easily manage team members by adding or removing users as projects evolve.
- **Customized Access Control**: Define which users have access to specific tasks or projects, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.

### 5. Notifications
- **Real-Time Updates**: Get notifications about new comments, task progress, and any significant project changes.
- **Deadline Reminders**: Receive reminders for upcoming deadlines to keep tasks on schedule.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Set preferences for what types of notifications users want to receive to minimize unnecessary interruptions.

### 6. Reporting
- **Detailed Performance Reports**: Generate reports on project progress, task completion, and individual/team productivity.
- **Resource Utilization Reports**: Analyze how resources are used across projects to identify potential optimizations.
- **Exportable Reports**: Export reports to share with stakeholders, clients, or team members, providing transparency and accountability.

## Built With

- **Flutter**: The frontend is developed with Flutter, allowing for a responsive, cross-platform experience that works seamlessly on Android, iOS, and web.
- **Firebase**: The backend utilizes Firebase for real-time data synchronization, user authentication, storage, and notification management.
